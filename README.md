# SnakeGame
Traditional Snake Game: eat the fruit and grow bigger in size.
Main.cpp contains all the code for this project. The whole game is contained within a game loop that first draws the map in a simple way by
checking the position of each element in the map and drawing a specific character that represents the snake, the fruit and the borders.
The game loop will then check for a user input which choices are contained in an enum to restrict keys in the keyboard. Finally, the loop
checks for the game logic, pretty much checking for collisions and depending the object which you collide with an outcome will happen.

Again, this is a very simple SnakeGame, but it shows an understanding of C++.
